[Version 0.6]
- Refactored the inner code to have DbCommandsMaker that should be inherited and implemented
    foreach provider lies under System.Data.[Provider]
	(this maker knows itself from being registerd during runtime with the specified Provider name in the <add> connection in configuration file.

- fast access to the schema of the database Tables with columns
    (tested for sql server , compact, and ole db databases)

- ole databases includes new and old office applications excel, and access.
	(fun fact: the provider for oledatabases is System.Data.OleDb)
	however there is another provider in the connectionString itself that specify the target of the file being opened 
	if access or excel and if new or old formats
	like 
	- "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=..."
	- "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=..."


- Drop Table statement in DbProbe. has been added.

- What's Next :
	* Making separate commands maker in separate projects (aka dlls)
		 for SqliteCommandsMaker, and MySqlCommandsMaker.
	* Implementing new idea of writing to/ reading from .. multiple databases in the same time with one call 
		may be we can invent new provider 
		System.Data.MirroredData
		and in connection string it becomes
		<add  name="mymirror" provider="System.Data.MirroredData" connectionstring="Keys= sqlserver1,sqlserver2, mysqlA, ..., etc;" />

		this way we can store the data in multiple locations.

        also in reading we can get the data that were fetched faster than others.
		(its a lot of problems of this module but needs good thinking)
