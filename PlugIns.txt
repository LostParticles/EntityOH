The library supports some sort of plug-in

it searches for a class that it inherited from 
	DbCommandsMaker<Entity>  
in dll files  on this pattern  *.EntityOH.dll

so that we can separate the files and load only necessary modules.


check Providers folder  SqlServerCe.EntityOH  and the attribute there.
